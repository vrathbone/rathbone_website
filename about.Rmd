**Interests:** 
Conservation planning, wildlife conservation, data visualization and science communications.

**Experience:**
Vanessa graduated from Brown University in 2008 with a double BA in Sustainable Architecture and Urban Studies. She looked critically at how sustainable design and the built environment affected communities and their access to surrounding natural environments. Upon graduation, she moved to Colorado to pursue her love of the outdoors and engage with public lands and agriculture. She ran several organic farm education programs and worked on biodynamic farms before becoming part owner of a local food start-up. There, she ran the sales and marketing working on long-term strategic planning, conducting market research and analysis, and executing multi-channel marketing campaigns. Her most recent role as a brand strategist combined her love of storytelling and using marketing to create lasting and positive change for clients including: social impact organizations, sustainability initiatives, foundations, policy shops, and educational institutions. Vanessa aims to combine her love of public lands and wildlife to help protect and restore natural migratory and mating areas on a global scale. She is currently pursuing a MESM at UCSB’s Bren School specializing in Conservation Planning with a media and communications focus.

**Projects:**
She is currently a masters student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management in Santa Barbara California. Over the past year she has been researching how to protect 30 critical shark and ray species in the Mozambique Channel in southeastern Africa. These species are targeted for the illegal fin trade and are all critically endangered. In particular, she is focused on identifying key areas to prioritize and designate as Marine Protected Areas, or MPAs, as part of a 30% Aichi Target commitment from the Mozambique government. These MPAs will provide a necessary respite from overfishing during these species life cycles which, in turn, will hopefully allow them to reproduce and increase their populations to less critical levels. So far, she and her team have found that there are many areas that can be prioritized to protect in the Mozambique Channel. The trick will be to recommend the areas that will be most effective not only for the conservation objective but will also be adopted by fisheries and have the least impact on fisher’s livelihoods. Like many conservation issues, this one is particularly challenging because of the lack of data due to the illegal nature of harvesting sharks and rays, also the lack of general marine data, and the challenges with enforcement. While these challenges do exist, without some sort of intervention, these shark and ray species that have been around for over 400 million years, will become extinct in our lifetime.

I am currently a master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. My degree is in Conservation Planning with a focus on strategic environemntal media and communications. My research includes both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, with a focus on data management and science storytelling. 

Before Bren, I worked in food start-ups, sustainable agriculture, outdoor education and most recently, I did brand strategy, communications and marketing for an advertising agency in Boulder, Colorado.

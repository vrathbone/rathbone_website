The goal of our project was to help the government ensure the long-term persistence of sharks and rays in Mozambique through an expanded network of marine protected areas. We created a reproducible model in R that prioritized areas to protect 26 species of sharks and rays with the least cost to stakeholders. Our project ran scenarios that looked at different fishing pressures on these species and how the reserve design changed based on each stakeholder.\nLearn more at https://www.future4fins.com/\n\n\n\n",

The data includes variables such as mean temperature, mean precipitation and elevation. We’ll be using a PCA bioplot to assess the correlation between these variables across countries on a global scale. This data could serve as a way to use environmental statistics to predict social and economic data. For example, are populations happier in sunnier or cloudier places? And are there differences in country’s economies where there are higher elevations vs. lower elevations?\nData Source: Venter, Zander and Google Earth Engine\nContent: This data is all acquired through Google Earth Engine where publicly available remote sensing datasets are collected.

In addition, tempurature seasonality and annual temperature range are also positively correlated.\nStrongly neagtively correlated variables include: slope or cloudiness and rain seasonality as well as isothermality and temperature seasonality.\nNot strongly correlated variables include: slope and annual temperature range, and cloudiness and mean annual temperature.\nWind, elevation, cropland cover and slope all have smaller variance than annual mean temperature, rain seasonality and cloudiness.\n\n\n\n",
